# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
~~~
x = ('a', 'b', 'n', 3, 5, 8, 'z')
has_n = 'n' in x
has_8 = 8 in x
print("Does the tuple contain 'n'? :", has_n)
print("Does the tuple contain 8?   :", has_8)
~~~

## Result
The Python program that checks if the element 'n' and the element 8 exist within a given tuple is ecxecuted successfully.
