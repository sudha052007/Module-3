# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
~~~
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total = 0
for num in numbers:
    total += num
print("The sum of all elements in the list is:", total)
~~~

## Output

## Result
The Python program that calculates the sum of all elements in a list is executed succesfully.
